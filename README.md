    - Amazon Clone Website -

    In this project I've been trying to learn the way the web developers of Amazon
    were thinking, their consideration, their preferences,
    how to name their DOM elements, how to arrange them, how to position them,
    As well as how to style them.

    My conclusion is that...
    While I am not entirely sure yet -
    There's no doubt that they knew what they're doing.
